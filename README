so, gruntfile.js is new

install its dependencies first, running "npm install" in this directory would
pick up devDependencies in package.json and install them into local
node_modules (which should remain unversioned/ignored)

you can run grunt tasks from command line after you've npm installed grunt :)

grunt sass:dev
  compiles sass to css in the same "expanded" format as is kept in the repo
  protip - if you do a lot of diffs on compiled css, add the following as
  "unimportant" to your diff tool rules:
    \/\*.*?\*\/
  yup, that's just a lazy regex matching css comments that will prevent
  different paths traced in sass lineNumbers comments from being picked up

grunt sass:prod
  compiles sass to css in the "compressed" format suitable for deployment to
  vuw master assets directory

grunt watch
  monitors scss files for changes and automatically compiles them with dev
  settings; this is handy when paired with burpsuite local style injections

<!--UPDATE 21/5/14-->
grunt watch 
  as above but will refresh the browser on save, runs with a script placed before the </body>
  tag. Will run on save for all file types, will only compile sass when saving a .scss file.

  grunt watch:sass
  to refesh browser on .scss save only. 

  livereload script
        <!--Live Reload script-->
        <script src="//localhost:35729/livereload.js"></script>
        <!--Live Reload script /end-->

NB: since config.rb has to be "located close to the Gruntfile.js" it is just a
clone of www/assets/config.rb with updated paths, this is needed for
grunt-contrib-sass compass support. You still need sass and compass gems :)
