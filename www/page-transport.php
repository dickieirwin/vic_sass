            <p class="intro">The compactness of Wellington - the buses, trains, walking tracks and the famous cable car make getting to and from the University a breeze.</p>

            <h2>Student parking</h2>
            
            <p>Coupon parking is available in the streets adjacent to the University plus there are a limited number of short stay car parks.</p>
            
            <p>Parking is at a premium at all the campuses. Student carparking is organised by <a href="http://www.vuwsa.org.nz/about/a-z-of-vuwsa-services/">VUWSA</a>. For further information, contact the VUWSA Office, Tel: 0-4-463 6716, Email: <a href="mailto:vuwsa@vuw.ac.nz">vuwsa@vuw.ac.nz</a></p>

            <h2>Public transport</h2>
            
            <p>Many students travel to and from the various campuses by public transport. You can get to the <a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz/home/about/maps/campus-kelburn">Kelburn Campus</a> from the city centre by bus or cable car, which runs up and down between Kelburn and Lambton Quay every 10 minutes.</p>
                                    
            <h4>Bus Links</h4>
            
            <p class="pull highlight highlight_tertiary">*Metlink is the new name for Greater Wellington's public transport network. For timetables and information about bus, train and harbour ferry services in the Greater Wellington region go to <a href="http://www.metlink.org.nz/">www.metlink.org.nz</a> or contact the Metlink Service Centre (formerly Ridewell) on 0800 801 700.</p>
            
            <p>Bus links are very good. Six separate bus routes stop at the Kelburn Campus and can take you to most points in the city. (Please note: the timetables below take you to the <a href="http://www.metlink.org.nz/">Metlink</a>* site, which includes a journey planner).</p>

            <p>All of these except Route 18 and 47 go either to the <a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz/home/about/maps/campus-pipitea">Pipitea Campus</a> or to the nearby Lambton Quay/Bowen St intersection.</p>
            
            
            <h4>Free Bus Passes</h4>
            
            <p>VUWSA provides free bus passes to students travelling between campuses. These are available from VUWSA's Kelburn, Pipitea and Karori Offices. All current students are entitled to a free bus pass, providing they meet the below requirements.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Undergraduate students:</strong></p>
            
            <p>You will need to log on to Student Records on <a href="https://my.vuw.ac.nz/cp/home/displaylogin">myVictoria</a> and print off and present the following documentation each time you need a bus ticket.</p>
            
            <p>Current study timetable which shows what classes you are doing, at which campus and on what days</p>
            
            <p>Your tutorial listing. This can be found on S-Cubed under My Signups. Like the study timetable, this tutorial listing will indicate what days your tutorials are along with their venues and times.</p>
            
            <p>Your Student ID.</p>
            
            <p>You are only entitled to a bus ticket if you have the above document(s) and have classes or tutorials on two different campuses on the same day. If you have classes or tutorials on separate days, you are not entitled to a ticket.</p>
            
            <p>To obtain a new bus ticket you need to keep your used ticket and return it once it has been all clipped out. Bring it back along with the documents outlined in 1, 2 and 3 above.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Postgraduate students:</strong></p>
            
            <p>You will need a letter written by your supervisor on Victoria University letterhead stating your name and that you require a bus ticket in order to travel between campuses for your research. The supervisor will then need to sign the letter with their name typed underneath it. It must also be dated.</p>
            
            <p>When you need a new bus ticket, you must bring this letter along with your used bus ticket.</p>
